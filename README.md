# VirtualShoppingAssistant

Think of it like a smart salesperson in a physical store, but available online 24/7. It can:

💬 Chat with users to understand what they’re looking for

🔍 Recommend products based on preferences, filters, or past behavior

🛍️ Show images, prices, and product details

🛒 Add items to the cart on your behalf

📦 Track orders and suggest alternatives

📚 Answer FAQs (like return policy, shipping info, etc.)
